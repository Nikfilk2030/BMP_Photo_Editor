# BMP_Photo_Editor
Toy project based on raw c++, program to interact with 24bit BMP photos.

# Overall Prewiew

This program is capable of apply filters to standart 24bit .bmp photos. 

# Description:

While working on this project my main goals were:

* Write some good code in c++
* Due to the fact that the task is large and complex, correctly decompose the task and connect everything in the best traditions of industrial programming
* Implement non-trivial filters (e.g. Gaussian blur filter)
* Write tests that cover all code and make sure there are no memory leaks
* Speed up the running time of the program (for example, the picture is not stored in a standard vector of vectors, but as an internal class)
